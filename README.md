# CAR-PRICE-Predictor-with-ML
# Car Price Predictor with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python project that predicts car prices using machine learning. The project utilizes a dataset of car listings, cleans and preprocesses the data, and builds a linear regression model to predict car prices.

## Introduction

This project aims to create a predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on its features such as company, year, kilometers driven, and fuel type. The model is trained using a dataset of car listings and can be used to predict prices for new car entries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `quikr_car.csv`. It contains various attributes of used cars, including:

- `name`: Name of the car.
- `company`: Company of the car.
- `year`: Year of manufacture.
- `Price`: Price of the car.
- `kms_driven`: Kilometers driven.
- `fuel_type`: Fuel type of the car.

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed in the `Quikr Analysis.ipynb` or the python script.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- pickle
